# Secret Family Recipes, Marketing page

This was my first official "Build Week" project in boot camp. While teammates further along in the curriculum built a backend, and a frontend to consume that backend - I worked to build this very basic marketing page. In a week I built 3 static html & css pages. 

Since then I've learned more and more about JS, Python, UX/UI Design, OOP and more - so I think it's time to revisit this little page, with a keener eye, and some darn javascript. 

Right now the project is deployed [here](https://sfr-marketing.vercel.app/)
